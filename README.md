# Data Compression Algorithms Implementation

This project implements several data compression algorithms in Python, including Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), Huffman Coding, and Arithmetic Encoding. These algorithms are commonly used for lossless data compression in various applications. The implementation includes functions for encoding and decoding text using these algorithms, as well as examples demonstrating their usage.

# Features:

- Run-Length Encoding (RLE) versions 1 and 2
- Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression
- Huffman Coding
- Arithmetic Encoding
